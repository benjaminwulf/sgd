### Introduction
üêöSHELL GAMING DOMINION set is set a near alternate future. Countries have morphed into capitalist-driven trade blocs. Companies and powerful individuals armed by digital supremacy use shadow currencies tipping the scales of a newly carved civilization. Paper FIAT monetary systems no longer exist. The ASCII-BINARY-HEX pact ensures political sovereignties remain dissolved as IPv6 and future Internet protocols intact firewalls as actual geographical borders. The FORWARD-LEDGER accounts all digital dealing as external forces shift from Earthly toward Intergalactic. A planet on fast-track towards apocalypse, structures of governance shift rapidly, engineered to face pending ZERO-DAY, while science discovery is obsessed with an antidote that will forever change our understanding of human consciousness.

### About the Author
Some write for fun, some to gain a paycheck, others write for survival. How hungry is your appetite to create? Become a serial diarist!

Since 2004, through my journal habit, I have accumulated 115+ journals ranging from Roaring Spring, Moleskin and Leuchtturm1917 in all sizes. Journaling is the base floor to the path from writer to author.
